# We are Qlik enthusiast who stand on the shoulder of giants

Welcome to our organization page. If you are here, I'll assume you're a Qlik enthusiast looking to take part on our community. We believe in community work and open source software. If we can stand on each other shoulders, we'll do wonders. Sharing is the answer to most of our technical struggles.

# What you can expect to find in our repos

We want to leverage Github and GCP to offer a simple solutions sharing platform. Each repo will be focused on one specific task or problem (eg.: data scrambling and anonymization in Qlik Sense) and should contain everything you need to use the solution. That ecompass technical components (eg. qvs, qvds, json, etc), but also documentation on how to use the solution.

# Our scope

Our scope is limited to Qlik Cloud products. For now (2022), this includes Qlik Sense (Analytics Service), Automation, Alerts, Reporting and AutoML.

# Policies and guidelines
1. Everything we do is open source with no strings attached.
2. We'll not use proprietary extensions for QS.
3. Our solutions can use load scripts, Qlik CLI, Qlik APIs and/or Qlik SDKs.
4. Solutions must keep all historic versions available and unchanged, to not disrupt previous implementations.
5. We'll use git flow to manage branches and merges. For more information, please check this amazing post from Jeff (https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-flow/).

# How to use our solutions

We try to keep options open, but we actively support (think about this when coding):

1) Download our solutions

You can opt to run the solution from your own storage service (Qlik Cloud, S3, GCS, etc). If so, please make sure you downloaded all files pertaining to the chosen solution. If the files are organized in subfolders at the original repo, please keep the same organization in your storage service.

3) Fork any repository and evolve in your own direction.

4) Fork any repo and make a pull request to help us grow the community.
